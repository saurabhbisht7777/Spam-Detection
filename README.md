# Spam-Detection
Emails are of two types: Hams and Spams. Spam is any irrelevant and unwanted message or email sent by the attacker to a significant.
Email spam, also called junk emails or unwanted emails, is a type of email that can be used to harm any user by wasting his/her time, computing resources, and stealing valuable information.

Spam emails may carry viruses, rats, and Trojans. Attackers mostly use this technique for luring users towards online services. They may send spam emails that contain attachments with the multiple-file extension, packed URLs that lead the user to malicious and spamming websites and end up with some sort of data or financial fraud and identify theft 

Spam filters detect unsolicited, unwanted, and virus-infested email (called spam) and stop it from getting into email inboxes. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) use spam filters to make sure they arenâ€™t distributing spam. Small- to medium- sized businesses (SMBs) also use spam filters to protect their employees and networks.

This project helps in filtering out spam mails using ML.
