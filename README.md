# Spam-Detection
Email spam, also called junk emails or unwanted emails, is a type of email that can be used to harm any user by wasting his/her time, computing resources, and stealing valuable information.
Spam filters detect unsolicited, unwanted, and virus-infested email (called spam) and stop it from getting into email inboxes. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) use spam filters to make sure they arenâ€™t distributing spam. Small- to medium- sized businesses (SMBs) also use spam filters to protect their employees and networks.

This project helps in filtering out spam mails using ML.
